## How It Works 🕹️

1. **Choose a Difficulty Level**: Select between two difficulty levels:  
   - **Easy**: Get 10 attempts to guess the number.
   - **Hard**: Push your skills with only 5 attempts!

2. **Make Your Guess**: Enter your guess and receive feedback:
   - "Too HIGH! Guess again."
   - "Too LOW! Guess again."
   - "That's it! You guessed the correct answer."

3. **Run Out of Attempts?** If you don't guess the correct number within your attempts, the game reveals the number, and you can choose to play again!
